The dataset central to our Wine Quality Prediction project pertains exclusively to the red variant of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, it encompasses a range of physicochemical properties alongside sensory quality ratings. Key attributes include levels of various acids, sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide content, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content, with the quality rating serving as our target variable. Reflecting the intrinsic qualities of the wine, these parameters offer insights into the factors that impact its perceived quality. Our analysis deliberately omits external influences such as grape type, brand, or price, thus focusing on the wine's inherent characteristics. The dataset, with its rich compilation of sensory and objective measurements, provides a fertile ground for applying machine learning to predict wine quality and offers a valuable resource for understanding the nuanced interplay of wine's compositional elements.
